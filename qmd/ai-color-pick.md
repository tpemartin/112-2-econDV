give me three color hex that are diiferent in hue but same on saturation and lightness

>>> ASSISTANT:
1. #FF4C29 (red hue)
2. #21FF4C (green hue)
3. #4C29FF (blue hue)

>>> USER:
for each color, give me another three color hex that are different only in saturation but same in hue and lightness

>>> ASSISTANT:
Sure! Here are three variations for each color:

1. #FF4C29 (red hue):
   - #FF8363 (higher saturation)
   - #FF190D (lower saturation)
   - #FF2A0E (lower saturation)
   
2. #21FF4C (green hue):
   - #5EFF8F (higher saturation)
   - #14FF39 (lower saturation)
   - #2DFF3F (lower saturation)

3. #4C29FF (blue hue):
   - #7B5AFF (higher saturation)
   - #261EFF (lower saturation)
   - #361DFF (lower saturation)


>>> USER:
Create a panel data frame that has "department" as identity dimension and "year" from 2014 to 2018 as time dimension. The "share" column records the teacher-student share of each department in each year. The "faculty" column records the faculty that the department belongs to. There are three different faculties

>>> ASSISTANT:
```r
library(tidyverse)

# Create a data frame with all combinations of department and year
panel_data <- expand_grid(
  department = c("Dept A", "Dept B", "Dept C", "Dept D", "Dept E"),
  year = 2014:2018
)

# Add share and faculty columns
panel_data <- panel_data %>%
  mutate(
    share = case_when(
      department == "Dept A" ~ c(0.25, 0.28, 0.22, 0.27, 0.24),
      department == "Dept B" ~ c(0.18, 0.21, 0.19, 0.20, 0.22),
      department == "Dept C" ~ c(0.30, 0.32, 0.29, 0.31, 0.33),
      department == "Dept D" ~ c(0.22, 0.24, 0.21, 0.23, 0.25),
      department == "Dept E" ~ c(0.27, 0.29, 0.26, 0.28, 0.30)
    ),
    faculty = case_when(
      department %in% c("Dept A", "Dept B") ~ "Faculty of Science",
      department %in% c("Dept C", "Dept D") ~ "Faculty of Arts",
      department == "Dept E" ~ "Faculty of Engineering"

Create a graph:
  - Layer 1: 
    - geom: line
    - x: date
    - y: share
    - color: departments in "Faculty of Science" uses different colors that has the same hue and lightness as #FF4C29, but differs in saturation. "Faculty of Arts" uses different colors that has the same hue and lightness as #21FF4C, but differs in saturation. "Faculty of Engineering" uses different colors that has the same hue and lightness as #4C29FF, but differs in saturation.
