## Primary, secondary, tierary color

AI>>
When it comes to color, obey the following rules:
  1. The primary color should always be muted "red".    
  2. The secondary color should alway be muted "blue", less saturated than the primary color.  
  3. The tertiary color should always be muted "green", less saturated than the secondary color.   
  4. Variants to a color should stay as close hue to the color as possible to preserve their analogy, yet can tell the difference.
As to sequence of layers, the primary color should be the last layer, the secondary color should be before the last layer, and the tertiary color should be before the secondary color layer.

## Neutral color

White, black, and gray are neutral colors. They are used to create contrast and hierarchy in a design. White is the lightest color, black is the darkest, and gray falls somewhere in between.
