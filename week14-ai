data_long data frame has the following structure:
$ date       <date> 2000-01-01, 2000-01-01…
$ company    <chr> "Microsoft", "Apple", "…
$ market_cap <dbl> 0.12875775, 0.23114116,…
Give me a line plot of market_cap of different company across dates.

Alphabet should use primary color;
Microsoft and Apple use secondary color of different variants; as to Amazon and Facebook, they use tertiary color of different variants.

Lines with secondary and tiertiary colors should have alpha = 0.5.
